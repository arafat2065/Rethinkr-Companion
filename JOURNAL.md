## 10/6/2025 - Rethinkr Companion — Journal Entry (Day 1–3)  

# 🧠 Rethinkr Companion – Build Journal  
**Days 1–3: Research, Learning, and KiCad Setup**

---

## 🗓️ Day 1 – Getting My Bearings
Today was all about understanding what I’m actually trying to build.  
The Rethinkr Companion is more than just a wearable — it’s meant to be a “thinking partner,” a small on-device system that can listen, process audio, and help you reason and remember.  

As someone new to hardware, I started by exploring how people actually design and simulate circuits. I went through tutorials on:
- What a **schematic** is and how it translates to a PCB  
- How to use **KiCad** (schematic editor + PCB layout)  
- The difference between **resistors, capacitors, regulators**, and **MCUs**  

By the end of the day, I installed KiCad, tested a few example projects, and created my first blank schematic for the Rethinkr Companion.  
It felt like opening the blueprint of my own brain — complicated, but exciting.

**Goal reached:** Environment ready + mental model built.

## 🗓️ Day 2 – Diving into Components
Today I focused on learning *why* each component in the system exists.  
I researched:
- **ESP32-S3** (the microcontroller) – it handles logic, Wi-Fi, and I2S for audio.  
- **MEMS microphone** (INMP441) – converts sound into digital signals.  
- **TP4056** (charging IC) – controls battery charging safely.  
- **LDO regulators** – create stable 3.3V and 1.8V rails for clean power.  
- **Resistors and capacitors** – used for pull-ups, filtering, and decoupling noise.  

I drew a rough block diagram of how everything connects — from the mic to the MCU, to the storage and headphone output.  
I also read about **power routing**, **ground planes**, and how even a short trace can affect signal quality in audio circuits.  

**Goal reached:** Understood the building blocks and relationships between components.

## 🗓️ Day 3 – Starting in KiCad
Today was the first *real* hands-on step.  

It wasn’t perfect — I made some mistakes with symbol alignment and had to correct power nets multiple times.  
But by the end of the session, I could see the **core power system** (USB → Charger → Battery → 3.3V LDO → MCU) coming to life on screen.  

The feeling was surreal — the moment the schematic looked “real,” I realized this project isn’t just a concept anymore.  

**Goal reached:** Core schematic structure + confidence boost as a beginner.

### 🌱 Reflection
Three days in, I’m still learning slowly, but I’ve started to “think like a circuit.”  
Each component isn’t just a part — it’s a piece of behavior.  
And with every datasheet I read, the Rethinkr Companion feels less like a dream and more like something that can exist.

**Next goals:**
- Finish the MCU and microphone I2S connections  
- Simulate power flow and signal integrity  
- Start basic PCB layout planning
